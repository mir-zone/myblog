I"¾<p>Having trouble working with the theme? Found a typo in the documentation? Interested in adding a feature or <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues">fixing a bug</a>? Then by all means <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/new">submit an issue</a> or <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">pull request</a>. If this is your first pull request, it may be helpful to read up on the <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">GitHub Flow</a> first.</p>

<p>Minimal Mistakes has been designed as a base for you to customize and fit your siteâ€™s unique needs. Please keep this in mind when requesting features and/or submitting pull requests. If itâ€™s not something that most people will use, I probably wonâ€™t consider it. When in doubt ask.</p>

<p>This goes for author sidebar links and â€œshare buttonâ€ additions â€“ I have no intention of merging in every possibly option, the essentials are there to get you started :smile:.</p>

<h2 id="pull-requests">Pull requests</h2>

<p>When submitting a pull request:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Clone the repo.</li>
  <li>Create a branch off of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> and give it a meaningful name (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-awesome-new-feature</code>) and describe the feature or fix.</li>
  <li>Open a pull request on GitHub.</li>
</ol>

<p>Theme documentation and demo pages can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/mir-zone/myblog/blob/master/docs"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/docs</code></a> folder if youâ€™d like to tackle any â€œlow-hanging fruitâ€ like fixing typos, bad grammar, etc.</p>
